My portfolio features my accomplishments and projects, all crafted using modern technologies such as Remix, Three.js, and Framer Motion. Explore the live site or dive into the live version of the [components storybook](https://storybook.hamishw.com).


## Install & run

Make sure you have nodejs `19.9.0` or higher and npm `9.6.3` or higher installed. Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Once it's done start up a local server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To view the components storybook:

```bash
npm run dev:storybook
```

## Deployment

I've set up the site using Cloudflare for hosting. Deploy the site to Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Permissions

Feel free to use the code or parts of it for your own siteâ€” it's open source, and I encourage learning from and adapting it. However, I recommend customizing the theme and components to make it your own. If you choose to use the design with minimal modifications, I would appreciate being credited as the designer.
